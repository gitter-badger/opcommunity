Welcome to openpilot
======

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, it performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Automated Lane Centering (ALC) for selected Honda, Toyota, Acura, Lexus, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru, Volkswagen. It's about on par with Tesla Autopilot and GM Super Cruise, and better than [all other manufacturers](http://www.thedrive.com/tech/5707/the-war-for-autonomous-driving-part-iii-us-vs-germany-vs-japan).

The openpilot codebase has been written to be concise and to enable rapid prototyping. We look forward to your contributions - improving real vehicle automation has never been easier.

Hardware
------

At the moment openpilot supports the [EON DevKit](https://comma.ai/shop/products/eon-dashcam-devkit). A [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness) is recommended to connect the EON to the car. We'd like to support other platforms as well.

Install openpilot on a neo device by entering ``https://openpilot.comma.ai`` during NEOS setup.

User Data / chffr Account / Crash Reporting
------

By default, openpilot creates an account and includes a client for chffr, our dashcam app. We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

It's open source software, so you are free to disable it if you wish.

It logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The user facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings.
It does not log the microphone.

By using it, you agree to [our privacy policy](https://my.comma.ai/privacy). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma.ai. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma.ai for the use of this data.
