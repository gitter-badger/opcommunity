This README describes the custom features build by me (Arne Schwarck) on top of [ArnePilot](http://github.com/commaai/ArnePilot) of [comma.ai](http://comma.ai). This fork is optimized for the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid 2016 and for driving in Germany but also works with other cars and in other countries. If you would like to support the developement on this project feel free to https://www.patreon.com/arneschwarck

# Installation
Put this URL in the custom URL field after uninstalling through the UI
https://d.sdut.me/arne/release4
or if you want to use the command line or https://github.com/jfrux/workbench
`cd /data; rm -rf openpilot; git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/arne182/openpilot -b release4; reboot`

still have trouble ?? More info about how to install this fork can be found [here](https://medium.com/@jfrux/comma-eon-installing-a-fork-of-openpilot-5c2b5c134b4b).
## Panda flashing

This is done automatically otherwise run (pkill -f boardd; cd /data/openpilot/panda/board; make; reboot) to change the following:
- allowing no disengage on brake and gas for Toyota
- changing acceleration limits for Toyota and
- adapting lane departure warning where it gives you a slight push back into the middle of the lane without needing to be engaged (not yet complete)
- The Panda version is also changed and checked.

## Branches

`release4`: this is the default branch that is most up to date with the ArnePilot 0.7 release branch. Normally you should use this branch because it has been tested and verified that it is fully working without any issues.

`075-clean`: this is my old testing branch. I moved on to 077.

`077-clean`: Heavily in early early in development branch of OP 077. Not recommended for any use out of testing. Is missing many features like trafficd and a working Ui. May crash and lag.

`release3`: this is my old branch, that is compatible with ArnePilot 0.6.

`release2`: this is my old branch, that is compatible with ArnePilot 0.5.

# Configuration

- You can turn on or off some of the [Feature](https://github.com/arne182/ArnePilot/blob/81a3258da49e1bb9739a5f1d0a84b38afd10583f/common/op_params.py#L500) by editing `op_edit.py`. Run the following command `python /data/openpilot/op_edit.py`

# Features

- Braking:
    - by angle(carstate),
    - by predicted angle in 2.5s(laneplanner),
    - by model(commaai),
    - acceleration measured by steering angle,
    - by curvature (mapd),
    - by mapped sign(stop, yield, roundabouts, bump, hump, traffic light, speed sign, road attribute)
- No disengage for gas, only longitudinal disengage for brake, tire slip or cancel
- Only disengage on main off and on brake at low speed
- Reacting Toyota tssp higher acceleration and braking limits.
- Speed sign reading
- Stock Toyota ldw steering assist
- Cruise set speed available down to 7 kph
- Smooth longitudinal controller also at low speeds
- No disengage for seat belt remove and door opened. Practical for when stopping and then someone opens a door so that the car does not drive into the lead
- No fingerprint compatibility problems. A completely different way to combine and split Fingerprints so that they always work I.e. comma is not supporting rav4h 2019 because of this Fingerprint method. Mine is better
- Custom events and capnp structure so that comma is happy with the drives from my fork
- Forward collision warning actually brakes for you.
- Blind Spot Monitoring for all of the toyota which will be added to control ALC(vision based lane change from comma.ai). For right now it is always on. It will flash rapidly when stopped and if the object is detected.
- Ability to ruduce or Increase curvature Factor from `op_edit.py` (`python /data/ArnePilot/op_edit.py`) It will also works with eco and sport mode. If using eco mode then it will start breaking early (350 m before) if using sport mode it will slow down little late (150 m).
- Ability to change the SpeedLimit Offset directly from APK. It is based in percentages. For Example, if -1% at 60mph, it will be  approx. 59.4mph, -10% is roughly 54mph etc. (Thank you eFini for the help)
- Dashcam recording button added to the ui. ( it will save video's to the `/data/media/0/video`)
- GPS Accurecy on the Dev UI.
- Live speedlimit_offset in op_tune.py
- If the model detect's cut in it will draw two different chevron to show the user that it see's both of the car.
- Control 3 gas profiles with sport eco and normal buttons on car ( only for toyota).
- [Dynamic distance profiles](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/ArnePilot/tree/stock_additions-devel#dynamic-follow-3-profiles) from Shane (In other word three different dynamic profiles: `close`, `normal`, `far`, `auto`). Profile can be adjusted from either `python /data/ArnePilot/op_edit.py` or use live tuner to change the profile live (can take up to 4 sec to for new profile to be adjusted) `python /data/ArnePilot/op_tune.py`.
- Dynamic Follow Button: Now you can change the Dynamic Follow Distance just by tapping the blue button on the bottom right.
- [Dynamic Gas:](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/ArnePilot/tree/stock_additions-devel#dynamic-gas)
This aims to provide a smoother driving experience in stop and go traffic (under 20 mph) by modifying the maximum gas that can be applied based on your current velocity and the relative velocity of the lead car. It'll also of course increase the maximum gas when the lead is accelerating to help you get up to speed quicker than stock. And smoother; this eliminates the jerking you get from stock ArnePilot with comma pedal. It tries to coast if the lead is only moving slowly, it doesn't use maximum gas as soon as the lead inches forward :). When you are above 20 mph, relative velocity and the following distance is taken into consideration.
- ALC w/ BSM : (Automatic Lane Change with Blind spot monitoring) you can now change lane automataclly. It will wait 1 sec before applying ALC. If the BSM detacts objects it will stop the lane change and will take you back in your original lane. Also, it will notify the user on the eon
- Added ability to turn on and off RSA at certain speed. `python /data/ArnePilot/op_edit.py`
- Easily view the EON's IP Address.Just look at the sidebar right under wifi singal strength's.
- Battery has percentage instead of the battery icon.
- [WIP] Traffic light detection from Littlemountainman, shane and brain. To get accurate result make sure your daily commute/area is mapped on [OSM](openstreetmap.org) with right direaction. [For example](https://imgur.com/purBVpd)...  [still dont get it watch the video by mageymoo1](https://youtu.be/7dPaF0tDb7Y).
- We also have enabled commas e2e model which will only work between 11 MPH to 29 MPH. Commas e2e model helps slows down for traffic light, stop sign, etc. e2e, traffic model and mapd all works together to help you stop at the light. All of this can be turned off via `/data/openpilot/op_edit.py`.
- Loggin has been Disabled by default on this fork. If you would like to record your drive edit the [following line](https://github.com/arne182/ArnePilot/blob/4d66df96a91c9c13491a3d78b9c1c2a9e848724a/selfdrive/manager.py#L480)
- Smart speed (smart speed is essentially speedlimit which eon will not go over unless you have set custom offset) can be overridden by pressing gas above the current smart speed.

What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported [car makes, models and model years](#supported-cars). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers.

Integration with Stock Features
------

In all supported cars:
* Stock Lane Keep Assist (LKA) and stock ALC are replaced by openpilot ALC, which only functions when openpilot is engaged by the user.
* Stock LDW is replaced by openpilot LDW.

Additionally, on specific supported cars (see ACC column in [supported cars](#supported-cars)):
* Stock ACC is replaced by openpilot ACC.
* openpilot FCW operates in addition to stock FCW.

openpilot should preserve all other vehicle's stock features, including, but are not limited to: FCW, Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), auto high-beam, blind spot warning, and side collision warning.

Supported Hardware
------

At the moment, openpilot supports the [EON DevKit](https://comma.ai/shop/products/eon-dashcam-devkit) and the [comma two](https://comma.ai/shop/products/comma-two-devkit). A [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness) is recommended to connect the EON or comma two to the car. For experimental purposes, openpilot can also run on an Ubuntu computer with external [webcams](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools/webcam).

<sup>1</sup>Requires an [OBD-II car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/comma-car-harness) and [community built giraffe](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/GM). ***NOTE: disconnecting the ASCM disables Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB).*** <br />
<sup>2</sup>Requires a custom connector for the developer [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness) <br />

Although it's not upstream, there's a community of people getting openpilot to run on Tesla's [here](https://tinkla.us/)

Community Maintained Cars and Features are not verified by comma to meet our [safety model](SAFETY.md). Be extra cautious using them. They are only available after enabling the toggle in `Settings->Developer->Enable Community Features`.

To promote a car from community maintained, it must meet a few requirements. We must own one from the brand, we must sell the harness for it, has full ISO26262 in both panda and openpilot, there must be a path forward for longitudinal control, it must have AEB still enabled, and it must support fingerprinting 2.0

Installation Instructions
------

Install openpilot on an EON or comma two by entering ``https://openpilot.comma.ai`` during the installer setup.

Follow these [video instructions](https://youtu.be/lcjqxCymins) to properly mount the device on the windshield. Note: openpilot features an automatic pose calibration routine and openpilot performance should not be affected by small pitch and yaw misalignments caused by imprecise device mounting.

Before placing the device on your windshield, check the state and local laws and ordinances where you drive. Some state laws prohibit or restrict the placement of objects on the windshield of a motor vehicle.

You will be able to engage openpilot after reviewing the onboarding screens and finishing the calibration procedure.

Limitations of openpilot ALC and LDW
------

openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW do not automatically drive the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be paid to operate your vehicle. The driver must always keep control of the steering wheel and be ready to correct the openpilot ALC action at all times.

While changing lanes, openpilot is not capable of looking next to you or checking your blind spot. Only nudge the wheel to initiate a lane change after you have confirmed it's safe to do so.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* When in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.
* In the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.
* When driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of openpilot ACC and FCW
------

openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW are not systems that allow careless or inattentive driving. It is still necessary for the driver to pay close attention to the vehicleâ€™s surroundings and to be ready to re-take control of the gas and the brake at all times.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera or radar are obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* Approaching a toll booth, a bridge or a large metal plate.
* When driving on roads with pedestrians, cyclists, etc...
* In presence of traffic signs or stop lights, which are not detected by openpilot at this time.
* When the posted speed limit is below the user selected set speed. openpilot does not detect speed limits at this time.
* In presence of vehicles in the same lane that are not moving.
* When abrupt braking maneuvers are required. openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of deceleration and acceleration that it can produce.
* When surrounding vehicles perform close cut-ins from neighbor lanes.
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Interference from other equipment that generates radar waves.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of openpilot DM
------

openpilot DM should not be considered an exact measurement of the alertness of the driver.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot DM, causing it to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Low light conditions, such as driving at night or in dark tunnels.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* The driver's face is partially or completely outside field of view of the driver facing camera.
* Right hand driving vehicles.
* The driver facing camera is obstructed, covered, or damaged.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. A driver should not rely on openpilot DM to assess their level of attention.

User Data and comma Account
------

By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data by pairing with the comma connect app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comma-connect/id1456551889), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.comma.connect&hl=en_US)). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

openpilot logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

By using openpilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://my.comma.ai/privacy). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes ISO26262 guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) for more detail.
* openpilot has software in the loop [tests](.github/workflows/test.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The safety model code lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software in the loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware in the loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware in the loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 EONs continuously replaying routes.

Testing on PC
------

Check out the tools directory in master: lots of tools you can use to replay driving data, test and develop openpilot from your pc.

Community and Contributing
------

openpilot is developed by [comma](https://comma.ai/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot). Bug fixes and new car ports are encouraged.

You can add support for your car by following guides we have written for [Brand](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot-7ce0785eda84) and [Model](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models-e5467f4b5fe6) ports. Generally, a car with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is a good candidate. [Join our Discord](https://discord.comma.ai) to discuss car ports: most car makes have a dedicated channel.
